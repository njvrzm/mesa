Testing and Code Standards
--------

.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/projectmesa/mesa/badge.svg
    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/projectmesa/mesa

As part of our contribution process, we practice continuous integration and use Travis to help enforce best practices.

If you're changing previous Mesa features, please make sure of the following:

- Your changes pass the current tests.
- Your changes pass our style standards.
- Your changes don't break the models or your changes include updated models.
- Additional features or rewrites of current features are accompanied by tests.
- New features are demonstrated in a model, so folks can understand more easily.

To ensure that your submission will not break the build, you will need to install Flake8 and Nose.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flake8 nose

We test by implementing simple models and through traditional unit tests in the tests/ folder. The following only covers unit tests coverage. Ensure that your test coverage has not gone down. If it has and you need help, we will offer advice on how to structure tests for the contribution.

.. code-block:: bash

    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=mesa

With respect to code standards, we follow `PEP8`_ and the `Google Style Guide`_. If the command below generates errors, fix all errors that are returned.

.. code-block:: bash

    flake8 . --ignore=F403,E501,E123,E128 --exclude=docs,build
